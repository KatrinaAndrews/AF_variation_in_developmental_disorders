GABRB2,dn,27789573,"This discrepancy suggests that, in addition to compromising subunit protein trafficking, the p.Thr287Pro mutation also functionally impairs the mutant GABAA receptors that do reach the surface. This impaired channel function may be due to a dominant negative effect of p.Thr287Pro mutation in TM2, a domain that contributes to the pore of the GABAA receptors along with corresponding domains of other subunits."

KLHL7,dn,21828050,"Together, our results suggest that KLHL7 constitutes a Cul3-based E3 and that the disease-causing mutation inhibits ligase activity in a dominant negative manner, which may lead to the inappropriate accumulation of the substrates targeted for proteasomal degradation."

KRT16,dn,22336941,These findings together with our data suggest that both the dominant negative disruption of intermediate filaments as well as the exclusion of keratins from the network can contribute to PPK pathogenesis.

MAST1,dn,30449657,"The deletion of leu278 was associated with decreased levels of other MAST protein family members, whereas complete loss of Mast1 was associated with increased levels of other MAST proteins. These findings suggested that the leu278 allele acts in a dominant-negative manner."
MAT1A,dn,28748147,"Confirmation that MAT1A p.Ala259Val mutation causes autosomal dominant hypermethioninemia. The p.Ala259Val mutation falls in the dimer interface, and thus likely leads to dominant inheritance by a similar mechanism to that described in the previously reported dominant negative mutation, that is, by means of interference with subunits encoded by the wild-type allele."

MSX1,dn,8696335,"We propose that the Arg31Pro missense mutation produces the phenotype of FTA via a dominant negative mechanism. Because this homeoprotein is expected to interact with other transcription factors 18Â·21 and binds DNA 18, Arg31Pro MSXI could functionally inactivate partner proteins as well as perturb homeoprotein/DNA interactions. Haploinsufficiency is an unlikely mechanism by which this defect produces its phenotype because heterozygous MsxJ-1' mice, which have reduced Msxl mRNA levels compared to wildtype litter mates, had neither craniofacial nor dental defects9â€¢"

MYH14,dn,31231018,"Findings: We describe the third family carrying the R941L mutation in MYH14, and demonstrate that the R941L mutation impairs non-muscle myosin protein function. To better understand the molecular basis of the peripheral neuropathy phenotype associated with the R941L mutation, which has been hindered by the fact that NMIIC is largely uncharacterized, we have established a previously unrecognized biological role for NMIIC in mediating mitochondrial fission in human cells. Notably, the R941L mutation acts in a dominant-negative fashion to inhibit mitochondrial fission, especially in the cell periphery."

Indeed, unlike USHlB and nonsyndromic recessive DFNB2 patients, DFNAllaffected individuals have a less severe (moderate) post-lingual hearing loss with progression."

Functional characterization of the three mutations demonstrated reduced DNA binding and/or transactivation properties, with a dominant-negative effect on wild-type NKX2-5."
NLRP3,dn,14630794,These findings strongly suggested that the mutated protein exerts a dominant-negative or a gain-of-function effect over the wildtype product and that the null mutation of 1 allele would probably have no effect or would lead to a different phenotypic expression because of haploinsufficiency.
NOBOX,dn,17701902,"Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed that the missense mutation, p.Arg355His, disrupted NOBOX homeodomain binding to NOBOX DNA-binding element (NBE) and had a dominant negative effect on the binding of wild-type NOBOX to DNA."

To further explore variation in this gene, they sequenced CTNND2 in 362 additional autism families and identified 7 variants (additional observations of the original 2 missense variants, plus 5 novel missense variants). The authors also identified12 CNVs (10 deletions, 2 duplications) involving the CTNND2 gene in patients with autism from the literature, from the clinical cytogenetics laboratories at Emory University and Baylor College of Medicine, and from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE). Seven of the 10 listed deletions were focal deletions within CTNND2 overlapping one or more exons; 1 was de novo, 3 were maternal, 1 was paternal, and 2 were unknown. However, no clinical information was provided for the carrier parents. Duplications were partial duplications. The author stated that the incidence of loss-of-function variants in neurodevelopmental disorders was found to be significantly increased compared to independent cases referred for other indications.

The mutation, which was found by exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was not found in public databases, including gnomAD. Analysis of patient cells showed a 50% decrease in mRNA, suggesting that the mutation resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The findings were consistent with haploinsufficiency."

DSC2,lof,21062920,"Gehmlich et al. (2010) used transient transfection assays to study the function and expression of missense and frameshift mutations in DSC2. The authors conclude that the missense mutations result in a decrease of available DCS2 mature functional protein, and this decrease, rather than a dominant negative effect, is responsible for features of AVRD/C.  The functional studies on the frameshift mutation did not show a decrease in the amount of mature functional protein, but did show a decreased affinity to its binding partner plakoglobin (PG). The authors note that in vivo studies are still required to accurately assess the functional effects of mutations."
