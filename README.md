# Altered function mutations in developmental disorders

author: Katrina Andrews 

## Aim of project
To create a list of altered function (AF) pathogenic, loss of function (LOF) pathogenic, and benign variants in developmental disorder genes in order to compare and contrast their properties.

## A note on versions
I created these lists using old methods during my Academic Clinical Fellowship. This 'version 2' folder is an updated and improved pipeline created at the start of my PhD.
Improvements in file structure, version control, and code have been made.

## Subfolder explanations 

Data/small = small (less than ~1GB) data files
Data/large = large (more than ~1GB) data files: to be excluded from github sync
Data/temp = intermediate, temporary, or test data files: to be excluded from github sync
Output = valuable files that are created as the end product of the project
Scripts = procedural scripts that create data or output
Analysis = analysis scripts for exploring data and creating plots
test_scripts = an area where I save pilot code and any small inputs and outputs.  e.g. a small test vcf, a script to filter this vcf for a single chromosome -> if working then I'd create a 'full' script and put it in the appropriate project folder with inputs and outputs in the /Data section
