# Explanation of function of scripts

DDG2P_2021_vs_2023.Rmd = exploration of the differences between DDG2P 2021 and 2023. Finding ways to pick out AF and LOF genes using new annotations and exporting a gene list with relevant group annotations.

GETDATAClinvar.Rmd = script to filter CLinvar down to some smaller files (e.g. just build 38, just pathogenic/likely pathogenic entries), so that I'm loading a smaller file in to the local environemnt each time I use it. Also adds the 'normalised number of submissions to clinvar' annotation.
